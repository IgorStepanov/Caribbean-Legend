The holds of the Tartarus were filled with hundreds of black slaves bound for the Carribbean plantations. There was a man among those slave named Pedro Rivados, some Portuguese priests had taught him how to read and write\nHe managed to free a few dozen of slaves from their shackles and raised a mutiny. Alas, the rest of the slaves failed to join him. The revolt was quelled. The slavers tied Rivados hand and foot and left him in ship's hold to perish from hunger and thirst. A few days later the weather went bad and Betancourt's squadron was swept up by a powerful storm.\nDays later, after fighting the weather, the 'San Augustine' and the 'Tartarus', the only two ships still intact, were stuck in the middle of this Island. A lot of men died during those events, black and white, but many more managed to survive. The ex-slaves started a new life together and called themselves the Rivados in honour of Pedro Rivados, the liberator.";
