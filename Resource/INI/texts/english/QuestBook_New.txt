#QUEST JusticeOnSale
Side Job: Smuggler in Trouble
#TEXT 1
I agreed to help a band of smugglers rescue their captain, who is sitting in the prison of @<cityName>. Surely, I'd be better off without soiling my hands with this affair, but they've offered me a decent reward. I should talk to the commandant... or, perhaps, it's better to turn all those gallowbirds to the authorities?
#TEXT 2
Being occupied with more important affairs, I have forgotten about the captain I liberated from the prison and the deal with his boys. The rascal must have used his opportunity to sneak away. Well, so be it.
#TEXT 3
I liberated the captain of the smugglers and received my reward. Money has no smell.
#TEXT 4
I liberated the captain of the smugglers from the prison, but these scoundrels decided to deceive me! Alright, now they can strike their deals with the devil!
#TEXT 5
I informed the town authorities about the smugglers' plans - they can handle it by themselves from this point on.
#TEXT 6
Part of the smugglers managed to get away. The governor will surely be displeased with my slowness.
#TEXT 7
All smugglers got what they deserved. Now I need to report to the governor, and the deal is done.

#QUEST AffairOfHonor
Side Job: Matter of Honour
#TEXT 1
By chance, I met a very bad-mannered officer. I'll have to teach him some manners and uphold the honor of the girl. So, in two hours at the lighthouse we'll meet.
#TEXT 2
The churl is punished, and the outraged honor is upheld! I must tell this pleasant news to the girl. Quickly back to the town!
#TEXT 2_1
Oh hell. I missed the duel. What a fool I am.
#TEXT 3
A miserable father, a good-for-nothing son, the lady's honor... Alright, let's see how it ends up this time. Let's visit the tavern and the brothel for starters.
#TEXT 3_1
Excellent! Now there's only one little thing left - to slaughter the scoundrel.
#TEXT 4
The deed is done, and father and son can sleep well... until the next time. Oh, and I deserve a reward. Let's collect it!
#TEXT 4_1
Well, I missed it - so what? No big deal.
#TEXT 5
Are things looking that black if the authorities are issuing letters of marque to random rascals and drunkards? I should visit the tavern and see who is terrorizing the local populace.
#TEXT 6
One scoundrel less in this world. It's nice to do good deeds.
#TEXT 6_1
I have changed my mind - I won't fight. I'm just not in the mood. Besides, the girl should taste all the delights of being a concubine of a brave corsair compared to being a maid in the tavern.
#TEXT 7
A duel! And the reason can't be any weightier.
#TEXT 8
The insolent fellow got his due.
#TEXT 8_1
Perhaps I chickened out... I don't know.
#TEXT 9
A citizen told me about an intriguing way of making money: robbing partners at the game of cards, then accusing them of cheating and later killing them in a duel to avoid the spreading of undesired gossip. I should check out if it is true.
#TEXT 10
Yes, the citizen was right. Poor Tom, like the others, too, fell victim to the rascal. But I have put an end to this.
#TEXT 10_1
Pfff! Cards, sharpers, duels... I've got no time for this crap!
#TEXT 11
A fencing teacher is afraid of a fight - who would believe it! The governor's nephew will have a hard time with a teacher like that. But it's not my business, anyway. I'd rather see the merchant.
#TEXT 12
The mercenary is dead. Let's tell the teacher the good news.
#TEXT 12_1
That mercenary looked like a very tough guy. I decided not to fight him.
#TEXT 13
Yeah, these days the officers are not like they used to be. But even those strive to be killed in a duel instead of perishing in glorious combat. Well, I only need to make sure that the more worthy will live on. I have two days at most. I should start with the search for the mistress.
#TEXT 14
It seems that the officer I knew was lucky as opposed to the officer I haven't known, who is now dead. Now I should heed the advice of the seconds and leave the town for a while.
#TEXT 14_1
I decided not to interfere with someone else's affairs. Let them solve their own problems by themselves.
#TEXT 15
'Divine Justice' sounds great! I will have to interfere and defend the planter in a duel.
#TEXT 16
An ambush! I should have figured it out. Now the planter should have weighty arguments against his neighbor. Now to collect my reward: surely it was well deserved.
#TEXT 16_1
Interesting, can I now expect discounts from the local smugglers?

#QUEST BurntShipQuest
Side Job: Ship Replacement in @<cityName>
#TEXT 1
Harbor master @<portmanName> from @<cityName> asked me to find an extraordinary ship with a specific characteristic @<text>. He offered me a very decent reward. I have half a year at my disposal.
#TEXT 2
Well, it seems that harbor master @<portmanName> resolved all his issues by himself. I don't think he came off as a loser, anyway.
#TEXT 3
The harbor master was not so simple and he gave the insurance money to the usurer. Well, I still have the ship. Let's see how this works out.
#TEXT 4
I have received a reward for a unique ship - @<money> pesos. For such money, two similar ships can be bought. I must admit that the harbor master surely knows his business and can persuade the insurance office.
#TEXT 5
I decided to keep the ship for myself. It seemed to me that @<money> pesos is just too small a price for such a gorgeous ship.

#QUEST GiveShipLetters
Side Job: Lost and Found
#TEXT 1
A curious find! Someone was either in a hurry or just too absentminded - either way, he lost a full set of a ship's documents. I am certain that their owner will soon announce his loss.
#TEXT 2
Well, I did a favor for nice people, and it didn't cost me any effort.
#TEXT 3
Well, the world is not without good people. It's great that the owner will soon recover his loss!
#TEXT 4
Well, the world is not without good people. It was lucky that I dropped in at the shipyard.
#TEXT 5
The reward was small, but I spent almost no effort, anyway.
#TEXT 6
Perhaps, it's for the best. I gained little, but at least I don't have to bother myself with these documents now.
#TEXT 7
It's great when the merchant and the merchandise find each other so fortunately!
#TEXT 8
It's great when your favor is rewarded accordingly!
#TEXT 9
Unicuique secundum opera eius! The documents will soon return to their owner - and money has already slipped into my pocket.
#TEXT 10
I should have delivered these documents earlier, that way their owner wouldn't have to obtain a new set of documents.

#QUEST ReasonToFast
Side Job: A Reason to Hurry
#TEXT 1
A cute girl blabbed out that an officer from the garrison was hurrying to some cove so much that it had even distracted him from his fun and games. Perhaps it's worth investigating?
#TEXT 2
There are many windbags around. Perhaps, I was just imagining things?
#TEXT 3
Perhaps, I just gave way to the offended girl. I shouldn't have thought up what was missing...
#TEXT 4
What an ill-luck! That guy showed up at the very wrong time. Now it is too late to guess what they were up to...
#TEXT 5
It turned out that I was tracked by a pirate messenger, the patrolman was waiting for him here. But it seems I managed to pretend to be the messenger, @<sName>.
#TEXT 6
I tracked down the corrupt patrol officer and was convinced that he had dealings with pirates. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to arrest him. Still, he was duly punished.
#TEXT 7
I failed to talk to the patrol officer. Ah, hell with him, anyway!..
#TEXT 8
What an ill-luck! The patrol officer died, and his mystery died with him...
#TEXT 9
Judas in the military seeks to get his 30 'pieces' of silver. Interesting, what kind of favor can cost such a pile of @<sText>?
#TEXT 10
A questionable bargain! Still, @<sName> would not hunt this map without a reason.
#TEXT 11
@<sShipType> '@<sShipName>' with a cargo of @<sGoodsName> is hanging around without an escort. That's some useful information...
#TEXT 12
The governor keeps his valuables in his own boudoir? How careless of him...
#TEXT 13
Thank God, this is finally over!
#TEXT 14
A nice blade is a great reward! It's also worth seeing whether this map can cost a handful of gems!
#TEXT 15
I got a hold of a pirate map. I need to check whether it's worth the money as soon as I can!
#TEXT 16
Huh... That's how your trust in justice can turn against you... I was suspected of an attack on the patrolling party...
#TEXT 17
This affair was finally over, and, it seems, I didn't come off as a loser!
#TEXT 18
The lead of the patrolman was correct! The great prize will surely more than cover all my expenses.
#TEXT 19
How unfortunate. I failed to make any good of the information purchased for a crapload of money.
#TEXT 20
I had to give @<sText> just in order to not hear the hot breath of @<sName> behind my back. Next time I shall be more cautious when undertaking such adventures.
#TEXT 21
@<sName> will not part with @<sText> easily. I need to get out of here, and quickly.
#TEXT 22
It turned out that the pirates somehow learned about the blunder of the patrol officer. Well, it is his funeral, most likely, he's already dead, anyway, and it's high time for me to get out of here... It seems that there is no one left to tell @<sName> about my deeds...
#TEXT 23
The pirates knew that I had the map of @<sName>. Moreover, they also knew about the island where he had hidden his treasures. It's good that their wits were no match for their greed, as they failed to find the treasure before I did.
#TEXT 24
Considering that the forces were unequal, I was forced to hand over the treasure to treasure hunters of @<sName>. Next time I shall be more cautious when undertaking such adventures.
#TEXT 25
I managed to sink a pirate ship, on which this operation involving the patrol officer was orchestrated. The patrolman himself must surely be dead by now, the pirates never forgive blunders like that one... Well, it seems that there is no one left to tell @<sName> about my deeds...
#TEXT 26
I managed to come off clear out of this story with the patrolman. I don't think the pirates will chase me forever. Surely they have other things to do.

#QUEST PiratesOnUninhabited
Side Job: Saved from @<shoreName>
#TEXT 1
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They asked to be delivered to any inhabited cove. Well, I can understand them - they are at odds with the law, after all...
#TEXT 2
I delivered the shipwrecked pirates to @<toShore> and even received a small reward. Surely, it wasn't much, but still will not hurt...
#TEXT 3
I delivered the pirates from the uninhabited island to @<toShore>. But, these scoundrels demanded that I lend them money. I was forced to explain to them that I don't lend money to any of their kind.
#TEXT 4
I delivered the pirates from the uninhabited island to @<toShore> and even loaned them some money... I can't imagine how I would have struggled out of these dire straits, were I in their shoes...
#TEXT 5
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. They asked to be delivered to any inhabited cove in exchange for a treasure map. Well, we'll see about the map... Or should I just turn them in to the authorities? In that case, I am sure to receive my reward...
#TEXT 6
The rascal chose to trick me, but in the end, he paid for this.
#TEXT 7
The rascal didn't have the map on him, but he told me where captain @<capName> had hidden his loot. I'll have to check @<toShore>.
#TEXT 8
I don't know whether the treasure was in @<shore> or not. I failed to find it. Well, I can't say my expenses were too big, anyway.
#TEXT 9
The pirate was right. In @<shore> I have found a nice treasure indeed...
#TEXT 10
That pirate is surely no simple guy. It turned out that he had promised that treasure not just to me. Well, either way in the end I was the one to claim it.
#TEXT 11
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors from the wrecked pirate @<shipTypeName>. I should deliver them to any inhabited cove. Or simply turn them in to the authorities.
#TEXT 12
I decided that a bird in hand is better than two in the bush and turned the pirates in to governor @<mayorName>. I think it was the right thing to do, at least the money is already jingling in my pocket.
#TEXT 13
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors, put ashore by captain @<badCapName>. They claim that captain is sailing on @<ship> and deals in slaves. We have agreed to find him. If everything goes as planned, I will take the contents of the hold, and they'll get the ship.
#TEXT 14
I boarded @<ship>, and in her hold, I have actually found the slaves. Well, it turns out that having friends among pirates pays off sometimes...
#TEXT 15
I had to sink @<ship> and finish off the pirates as well. I guess no one will be upset about it.
#TEXT 16
In the heat of battle I have sunk @<ship>. I had to compensate her cost to the pirates. I couldn't have left them without any means for existence, after all, could I?

#QUEST ShipWrecked

At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard @<count> sailors, put ashore by captain @<badCapName>. I should deliver them to the nearest settlement.
#TEXT 5
At @<shoreName> I have met @<count> sailors from the wrecked @<shipTypeName> '@<ShipName>'. Their captain should have taken too many blows to the head; he demands to be delivered to Dunkirk. I have no clue what to do with them. So far, I have taken them onboard. I couldn't just leave them in this deserted place.
#TEXT 6
I delivered captain @<sName> and his sailors to @<sCity> and even received a small reward. Not too much, but won't hurt, either.
#TEXT 7
This insane captain demands to be delivered to Dunkirk and just doesn't want to leave my ship! His behavior becomes absolutely intolerable! I have no clue what to do in this situation!
#TEXT 8
That nutcase finally got what he was asking for. I had to finish him off. I simply had no other choice. He was talking about unimaginable treasures, while not having even a spoon. What a crook...
#TEXT 8_1
What kind of people went!? Circumstances have changed, but that's no reason to wave in front of people. I had to teach this rude person a lesson in good manners.
#TEXT 9
Finally, I managed to get rid of that shipwreck survivor and he even slipped me a piece of a map. I must cut and run before he realizes that I have tricked him. He-he... Dunki-irk... Dunki-iiirk...
#TEXT 10
At @<shoreName> I have met the shipwrecked sailors. I should tell the governor of the nearest settlement of @<sNation> about them. I guess, the provisions I have left for them will last long enough until the rescue ship arrives.
#TEXT 11
At @<shoreName> I met several sailors, put ashore by pirate @<sBadName>. I should tell the governor of the nearest settlement of @<sNation> about them. I guess the provisions I have left for them will last long enough until the rescue ship arrives.
#TEXT 12
I was too busy to return to that ill-fated cove. I can only hope that those poor souls were found and rescued by some other captain...
#TEXT 13
I told the governor of @<sCity> about the sailors abandoned at @<ShoreName>, but I have taken too long. Now we can only pray to the Lord that help will arrive in time...
#TEXT 14
I told the governor of @<sCity> about the sailors abandoned at @<ShoreName> and even received a small reward. The governor was delighted to hear that the captain of the wrecked ship managed to survive. He will set up a rescue expedition at once.
#TEXT 15
I delivered captain @<sName> and his sailors to the nearest settlement and was rewarded very handsomely, although I never asked for this...
#TEXT 16
At @<shoreName> I have taken onboard captain @<sName> and @<count> of his sailors. The captain claims that pirate @<sBadName> instigated his crew to mutiny, deprived him of his ship, and put the poor guys ashore. I promised him to seek out his ship '@<ShipName>' and return it to him, whereas I will receive the contents of her hold.
#TEXT 17
As we had agreed, I delivered the captain and his sailors to the settlement. My only reward was their thanks, but it didn't cost me anything anyway.
#TEXT 18
I boarded @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' and, according to our deal, gave it back to @<sName>. I took the contents of the hold for myself. Justice was served.
#TEXT 19
In the heat of battle @<ShipType> '@<ShipName>' was sunk and the contents of her hold, obviously, were lost as well. I feel very bad for captain @<sName>. But what was done, is done.

#QUEST JungleGirl
Side Job: Damsel in the Jungle
#TEXT 1
I promised @<sName> from the settlement of @<sCity> to bring her @<sText1> large and @<sText2> small pearls for the necklace of her mistress. I have only 10 days - otherwise, all my efforts could be in vain.
#TEXT 2
In exchange for the pearls @<sName> gave me a very nice amulet. Indeed, you never know where you lose something and when you gain something.
#TEXT 3
I failed to collect enough pearls for @<sName>. I feel sorry for the girl, but it's her fault, after all, she shouldn't have applied for work with such a fickle mistress...
#TEXT 4
@<sName> claims that she knows the location where her father, notorious pirate @<sPirateName>, has hidden his treasure. It's @<sTreasureLoc>. We should disembark at @<sShore>. After we find the treasure, I'll need to deliver her back to the settlement of @<sCity>.
#TEXT 5
@<sName> is dead, and I don't know the place where the chests are hidden. Pity, but this time I was out of luck.
#TEXT 5_1
I decided not to bother myself with the search for @<sName>'s father's treasure. She can deal with it by herself, if she chooses to.
#TEXT 6
The treasure of @<sPirateName> was vast indeed. I received my half. Now I need to deliver @<sName> back home to the settlement of @<sCity>.
#TEXT 7
@<sName> died. I feel sorry for the girl, she's just become rich... What a stupid death...
#TEXT 8
I delivered @<sName> home with her treasure. As a token of her gratitude, she made me a very nice gift... Indeed, it's very nice to make people happy...
#TEXT 9
Daughter of @<sText> in the settlement of @<sCity> has run away from home. She claimed that she hated to marry the usurer's son, and she begged me to take her to her chosen one, @<sLover>. And what should I do with her? I would hate to spoil her life for the rest of her days, but I can understand her parents as well...
#TEXT 10
@<sName> died... That's what happens when the young ones pay no heed to their parents...
#TEXT 11
I handed the runaway to the guards. Let them decide what to do with her...
#TEXT 12
In the settlement of @<sCity> the girl ran away from me, as well. Well, I can only hope that she finds her happiness, for which she is willing to sacrifice everything. Oh, the youth...
#TEXT 13
I took the runaway to her father, and I am certain it was the right thing to do. What can be worse than the woe of the parents who lost their only child? And her father rewarded me handsomely.
#TEXT 14
I took the girl to her chosen one. From now on they can go on their own, I am not their nanny.
#TEXT 15
I have undertaken to deliver the loving couple to the town of @<sCity>, to the parents of her new groom. I think this is the right thing to do.
#TEXT 16
I have delivered the loving couple where I promised. Now, I should go to @<sText> and claim my reward from the groom's father. I wonder how much happy he will be to see me?
#TEXT 17
I decided not to bother the groom's parents, surely they must have other concerns. Besides, my expenses in this affair were very small, anyway.
#TEXT 18
The groom's father thanked me and made me a very decent gift... I feel almost jealous for these two young lovers...
#TEXT 19
Seems that it was a waste of my time. Groom's father turned out a real miser. I almost feel sorry for the young couple - neither of them had any luck with their parents... People are too hard-hearted in this back of beyond and wouldn't talk of anything beside gold. Still, I am glad that I managed to help the young ones. They deserve a different life.
#TEXT 20
I have undertaken to deliver the girl @<sName>, who had fled from the brothel in @<sBrothelCity>, to her parents in @<sCity>.
#TEXT 21
I have undertaken to bring to @<sName>, who had fled from the brothel, her grip sack. I'll need to look for it in the privacy room. Inside there should be some money, documents, a decent dress, and other belongings of the poor girl.
#TEXT 22
I was too busy and had to leave the girl in the tavern. Still, I hope that she is smart enough to deal with it by herself.
#TEXT 23
I did everything I could. I can only hope that @<sName> makes it safely to her home.
#TEXT 24
I delivered @<sName> to the settlement of @<sCity>. I didn't bring her to her parents, they will surely have other concerns...
#TEXT 25
I delivered @<sName> home. I was rewarded with a decent blade and also deep moral satisfaction.
#TEXT 26
I delivered @<sName> home. I was rewarded with a great musket and also deep moral satisfaction.

It seems I have caught an infection. Apparently, the captain of '@<sShipName>' was not kidding about the epidemic. I will need to minimize my interactions with the crew and be more careful in the future.
#TEXT 2
The epidemic is declining. I have an appetite again, which means that I am getting well, thank God.
#TEXT 3
We have an epidemic on the ship. The sailors are perishing to disease. The captain of boarded '@<sShipName>', may he burn in hell, was not kidding... What do we have to do now? May the Holy Virgin save us all.

The disease is declining. Praise the Most Holy Mother of God! In the future, I definitely need to be more careful...

Holy father @<sName> tasked me with an errand: bring precious theosophical manuscripts, given by him for the sake of enlightenment and by the order of his superiors to the priest of @<sOwnerCity>, which he hasn't promptly returned. I undertook to help him in resolving this delicate matter.
#TEXT 2
Adult men, servants of God and acting like little children! Well, not a big deal, the most important thing is that I have the manuscripts! Now to take them back to @<sColony>.
#TEXT 3_1
Well, it's amazing to see how people try to vindicate their laziness and irresponsibility by some high purpose. How could one give such priceless things to a random person without any warranties? What a careless priest... Now I must chase that @<sCapName>, captain of "@<sShipName>" across the entire archipelago.
#TEXT 3_2
That will be not an easy task to seek for a ship, a name of which I don't know. And I must act quickly, before that God-fearing captain gets rid of these precious books... but the first thing to do is to find out, what is that SACRED name written by @<sCapName> on the backside of his old tub?
#TEXT 4
I wonder - why should I be the one paying for someone's religious impulses?! Goddammit! I do hope that near the colony of @<sColony> I will finally catch up with this old tub "@<sShipName>" and her God-fearing captain at the helm, and I will get these papers from him. Perhaps, the Lord will absolve me of a couple of sins for that.
#TEXT 5
Out of luck again. That @<sName> is surely an interesting guy: the priest entrusted to him an extremely valuable cargo, but the port officials are trembling just at the sound of his name. Well, we'll see how it works out when we finally meet in @<sColony>...
#TEXT 6
That captain is surely an interesting person. Well, it's time to meet him face to face, take those longed-for books from him and deliver them to their rightful owner in @<sColony>.
#TEXT 7
Today I have handed the priest of @<sColony> his precious manuscripts and received my reward together with a warning against the mortal sin of greed.
#TEXT 7_2
Old fool @<sCapName> made a debt in the tavern and gave the owner precious books and manuscripts as a pledge. Expenses and expenses again... I will buy out the manuscripts and finally deliver them to @<sColony>.
#TEXT 8
Another expense in my ledger: I have paid the debt of an old cachalot @<sName> in the tavern. The manuscripts of the priest in the colony of @<sColony> have been bought out, and now it's time to return his longed-for manuscripts to him and show him my expenses book as well!
#TEXT 9
In fact, there are yet unselfish tavern owners around. I will hurry to @<sColony> to return the theosophical manuscripts and tell the story about a tavern keeper, who gave away priceless books only to uphold his vow.
#TEXT 10
Oh, my... I would never imagine that such a simple task will be so time and effort-consuming. Well, at least the God-fearing captain @<sCapName> didn't cause me any trouble - he gave me the precious manuscripts and told me to get lost, which I gladly did. Now back to @<sColony>.

Side Job: Church Robbery in @<sCity>
#TEXT 1
Stealing the church money! What's wrong with this world?! Well, while Father @<sName> is bringing curses upon the heads of these scoffers, I should undertake more effective actions - and if the Lord does not reward me for them, then Padre certainly will... They couldn't have gone far...
#TEXT 2
People in the town say that the money was stolen by the local bandits, who were smart enough to go into hiding. Perhaps I should visit their hunting grounds.
#TEXT 3
Indeed, God gives everyone his due - the bandits got what they deserved, and I got the church money. Now back to see Father.
#TEXT 4
Isn't that nice? I did a favor to God and didn't forget about myself, either. A blessing!
#TEXT 5
That's even more than I could expect! Indeed, working for the church really pays off sometimes!
#TEXT 6
Well, I am rich and I am cursed. Whatever. With such money I don't care neither about God nor about Devil.
#TEXT 7
The jungle is full of scoundrels of all sorts, but I still haven't found those I was looking for. I'll have to get back to the town to get more precise information regarding their whereabouts.
#TEXT 8
The stealers of the church property were smarter than I thought, and they fled the settlement. I must hurry to @<sCity> on @<sIsland>, before they have wasted all their money on booze and hookers!
#TEXT 9
Well, smugglers turned out to be easy to come to an agreement with. They helped the scoundrels for money, and they betrayed them for money. Alright, to @<sShore>, then.
#TEXT 10_1
Now that's quite a story... Could Father @<sName> indeed be so treacherous? Well, anyway I should talk to him first - it might be that I am suspecting a completely innocent man...
#TEXT 10_2
Now that's quite a story... Could Father @<sName> indeed be so treacherous? Well, since I have killed all those scoundrels, no one but the padre himself can now confirm or disprove their words...
#TEXT 11_1
Finally, I have found the scoundrels. Surely, this was no Holy Grail, but still... Well, it's time to go back.
#TEXT 11_2
I hope that I did something good and when Doomsday comes, the Almighty will credit it on my account - I shared my belongings with the unfortunate in order to reveal to them the way of righteousness. By the way, I'll need to tell the Father that his church property was likely used for the same purpose as well...
#TEXT 11_3
Who could have thought that the church property could be so expensive... Well, at least I got something in exchange for the money. I'll bring the chalice to the padre - perhaps it will soothe his grief for the stolen cash...
#TEXT 11_4
Being poor is no sin... being a liar is! And God has rewarded such nobleness: the scoundrels who defied Him shall be put down, the church property will be saved, and I will receive my due reward!
#TEXT 12_1
I would like to believe that the repentance of the priest of @<sCity> was sincere. Of course, I have lost something from the material point of view - but moral satisfaction more than makes up for it!

What a twist of events! It turns out that even the priests can fall victim to greed. But, as they say, all is well that ends well. Father @<sName> managed to cope with his temptation and even compensated my expenses.

What a twist of events! It turns out that even the priests can fall victim to greed. But, as they say, all is well that ends well. Father @<sName> managed to cope with his temptation. But he forgot to compensate my expenses - perhaps he was too excited. I had to remind him about it.

That wannabe machinator tried to pay me only half of the promised sum. I had to explain to him who was right in this case. My arguments turned out to be very persuasive, and in the end, the commandant paid me even a quarter more. Still, I am certain that he didn't come off as a loser, anyway.
#TEXT 6
I decided to turn this mission down. 100,000 pesos is a whole lot of money, but I still value my own life higher than that.
#TEXT 7
At the exit from the town I was approached by some goons, who evidently were waiting for me. They kindly requested to give them all the money. Surely they were hired by that stinky rat. Well, I had to disappoint him yet another time...

At the exit from the fort I was approached by some goons, who evidently were waiting for me. They kindly requested to give them back all the money. Surely they were hired by that stinky rat. I decided not to tangle with them - they were very well-armed. I had to give away all my money...

Spooky Cemetery
#TEXT 1
The cemetery guard on the island @<sCity> is scared to death. According to him, for several nights now, there have been strange noises and eerie moans, like those of a ghost. Of course, I don't believe much in these tales but I decided to help the poor old man and see what's going on there. Worst case scenario, I'll either have to fight some marauders or run for my life if this is indeed a ghost. I just need to wait for nightfall.
#TEXT 2
It's both funny and sad. All these noises and moans are not the wailing of a ghost at all but merely secret meetings of a couple of lovebirds. Their parents are against them seeing each other, so they thought they would find a suitable secluded place. Now I can put the guard's mind at ease. On my way to him, I'll need to think of what to tell him.
#TEXT 3
I decided not to spoil the life of the unlucky couple and did not tell the guard about them. Young love... Hopefully, everything works out for them.
#TEXT 4
I told the guard the truth. He was, of course, furious at first but calmed down eventually. We've all sinned. This couple just didn't have another place to see each other. Young love... Hopefully, everything works out for them.
#TEXT 5
I decided that I did not care about any noises and terrible groans imagined by the watchman. My time is more valuable.

Six Captains
#TEXT	1
Perhaps this is the first time that a brief encounter with someone who had neither work nor business for me has made me record an entry in this journal. I don't understand why this priest made such an impression on me. I don't know his name, and he sometimes talked nonsense, but he made himself memorable. We've met twice now, and it could be dismissed as coincidence. But if we meet again...
I must admit, his interest is somewhat flattering. That look in his eyes is so... appraising. As if he admires my accomplishments. And who wouldn't? Two legendary ships, two captains whose tales spread across the entire Archipelago-both fallen by my hand.
I wonder what he'll say when he learns of my future exploits? The Archipelago is vast, but my fame, it seems, is growing faster than I thought.

Diego de Landa - that's what your name is. So we'll meet again. To be continued.

The Prologue
#TEXT	0
How sick I am of all this! Five days... and finally I'll set foot on dry land. These past two months have been a complete nightmare, and I simply cannot understand how any sane person would tie their life to the sea!
For now - the captain awaits me. I don't like him much lately. I don't like anything here anymore.
#TEXT	0.1
By all appearances, an interesting evening awaits me. For now, the captain has given me free rein... within the confines of the ship, ha-ha! I can return to him at any moment and end this tiresome day.
#TEXT	1
For 500 pesos I can sell 3 bottles of rum to sailor Henry on the upper deck. It seems the boatswain in the wardroom trades in various goods. Perhaps I should thoroughly search the ship and speak with other sailors.
#TEXT	2
Good thing I don't drink rum and was able to make a decent deal with Henry. The crew seems to have appreciated my efforts.
#TEXT	3
Sailor Paul hurt his back carrying cannonballs and asked me to help. The balls can be found in the hold — surely lying in one of the endless crates.
#TEXT	4
I barely dragged the damned cannonballs to Paul. That sailor is acting a bit suspicious, but I got a bottle of rum as a reward. A valuable prize, considering the demand for this poison around here.

I found the captain's key! I wonder what treasures it opens...

Dark waters of healing

In St. John's, they whisper that the local gypsy is the last hope for Thomas Morrison's gravely ill daughter. But she stubbornly refuses to help. Does she truly feel no pity for the poor girl?
#TEXT	2
The gypsy woman informed me that she is quite willing to help the girl, but Thomas flatly refuses to let her into his home. I want to visit Thomas and find out why he's rejecting the last hope for saving the girl. His house is in the northern part of the city, by the wall, next to a luxurious mansion with columns.
#TEXT	3
The local church priest threatened Thomas Morrison with excommunication if he accepts the gypsy's help to save his gravely ill daughter. Now Thomas is torn between his fear of falling out of the church's favor and his despair over his daughter's illness. I'll try to convince the priest to turn a blind eye to this sin for the greater good - saving the girl's life!
#TEXT	4
I'll have to find workarounds. The priest is undoubtedly stubborn, and in many ways he's right. But I still cannot agree with him. If there's a chance to get the girl back on her feet, it must be taken.
#TEXT	5
I managed to convince the priest. He agreed to turn a blind eye to the gypsy's involvement in the treatment if Thomas redeems himself before God through sincere repentance and good deeds.
   Now I need to find mangarosa - the key ingredient for the gypsy's potion. This plant is distinguished by its pleasant aroma, tall stem, and distinctive jagged leaves. I can find mangarosa in a cave outside town, from some 'unsavory characters' - likely vagrants or bandits. Well, all the better. I might not have to pay them at all.
#TEXT	6
I've done everything in my power. All that remains is to hope in the gypsy's abilities. I've become so involved with saving the little girl that I've completely forgotten my own affairs. I'll visit Antigua in a month. By then, Esther should be fully recovered.
#TEXT	7
The gypsy is ready to help the girl secretly, so Thomas doesn't incur the church's wrath. Now, the main thing is to convince him to trust us.
#TEXT	8
Thomas gave me Esther's personal item - jade beads. Now I need to find two stems of datura, one stem of ipecac, one of verbena, and I can return to the gypsy.
#TEXT	9
Through the gypsy's and my efforts, Esther's illness has been defeated! It's nice to know that all the efforts were not in vain, and the girl is now healthy.
#TEXT	10
Our efforts with the gypsy have overcome Esther's illness! It's heartwarming to know that all the efforts were not in vain, and the girl is now healthy. From the gypsy woman in Saint John's, I can always buy mangarosa - three stalks for three hundred and fifty golden doubloons.
#TEXT	11
Now the gypsy has everything needed to prepare the healing potion. Tomorrow morning I'll need to get the medicine from her and take it to Thomas.

Trade by Law
#TEXT 1
The citizens of Bas-Ter are complaining about the lack of alcohol in the tavern. The innkeeper keeps making promises to fix the situation, but nothing has come of it so far. It looks like he’s in serious trouble. And where there’s trouble, there’s an opportunity to make some coin.
#TEXT 2
The innkeeper said that his supplier from Antigua lost his distillery during a pirate raid and won’t be able to deliver anything for at least two months. The innkeeper is willing to accept any batch of wine and rum, provided the trader has a good reputation. No document checks this time, but in the future he will only work with honest and reliable merchants. Maybe I should try sourcing the goods through unofficial channels... If I play it right, there’s money to be made.
#TEXT 3
Smugglers don’t have any alcohol to offer right now. However, there’s a dealer living near the governor’s residence who’s been quietly trading in small amounts of spirits. Might be worth paying him a visit.
#TEXT 4
I managed to find the underground alcohol dealer. At first, he thought I was an agent of the authorities, but I convinced him otherwise. If I help him legalize his business, I’ll be able to buy wine and rum from him in the future on very favorable terms. But right now, it’s time to see the innkeeper - I might be able to make a few more doubloons on this deal.
#TEXT 5
I struck a deal with the innkeeper, on my terms. He’s willing to pay 240 doubloons for 100 bottles of wine and 100 bottles of rum, now and for future batches. Time to legalize Christian’s business.
#TEXT 6
I struck a deal with the innkeeper. He’s willing to pay 200 doubloons for 100 bottles of wine and 100 bottles of rum, now and for future batches. Time to legalize Christian’s business.
#TEXT 7
The innkeeper is happy - the tavern is flowing with alcohol again. Christian is happy too - he got a great client and his business is now legal. Now it’s time to think about my own profits in this deal. To Christian!
#TEXT 8
I found myself playing the middleman. Strange feeling. Everyone’s satisfied: the tavern is lively again, Christian is probably counting the doubloons raining down on him, and I now have a reliable booze supplier in the Caribbean. And not once did I have to draw my sword. Incredible.
#TEXT 9
Just as I was enjoying how everything had gone smoothly for once, I was attacked by a pirate ship in the port. As it turns out, the supply issues weren’t a coincidence - it was all part of a scheme by the captain of that ship, trying to take over the Bas-Ter tavern supply line. This time, he failed. He learned a deadly lesson.
#TEXT 10
I was attacked at sea by a pirate ship. Who they were and what they wanted - I’ll never know. Their vessel went to the bottom, taking all the answers with it.
#TEXT 11
The trade regulations on the island turned out to be quite simple: a hundred doubloons per month to the city treasury as a tax and timely reporting. I think Christian will handle those requirements just fine. Now to give the rogue the good news - everything went perfectly.

Edges of Justice
#TEXT	1
A bold attempt was made on the Port Authority Chief in Belize. The attacker managed to escape, and now he’s become the hunted. Rumor has it the official has put a price on his head. Well, the enemy seems formidable - I’ll need to think twice before going after him.
#TEXT	2
The head of the port claims he has no idea who attacked him or why. He calls the assailant a common madman - the kind that’s a dime a dozen in the Caribbean. That may not sound convincing, but I don’t care. There’s a reward of two hundred doubloons for this “madman’s” head. That’s what truly matters. I’ll begin the search in nearby coves and grottos. That’s where the fugitive is most likely hiding from justice.
#TEXT	3
It’s done. Time to report back to the Port Chief and claim my well-earned reward. And yet, perhaps I should have listened to what the mercenary had to say. He sounded quite convincing. Then again, who wouldn’t try to bargain for their life, clinging even to the faintest hope? Most likely, it was just another trick.
#TEXT	4
The Port Chief paid me in full, even more generously than agreed. He offered a permanent fifty percent discount on docking one ship for any period. But that generosity only deepens my suspicions. What if the mercenary spoke the truth? If he really encountered pirates, why didn’t he call the guard? Why didn’t he mention it when sending me after the “killer”? Still, it’s all speculation. What’s done is done, and perhaps only time will reveal the truth. I must move on.
#TEXT	5
The Port Chief is a true scoundrel! Smiling as he waves my comrades off to sea, then casually sells their ship routes to pirates. People like him must not go unpunished. I'll wait for nightfall and deal with him. deal with him. His filthy deeds will be exposed. The notes given to me by the mercenary will remain in his house, in plain sight. Let the whole town see him for what he really is. It's ironic that he lives near the prison-by rights, he ought to be an inmate.
#TEXT	6
The bastard is dead! Now I just need to leave the notes and vanish before the entire garrison is put on high alert.

The tavern keeper in Puerto Principe has somehow lost an entire barrel of rare gin imported from old Europe. If the missing goods aren’t found, the poor fellow could be in serious trouble. Judging by the panic, this shipment was meant for someone important - otherwise, why all the fuss?
#TEXT 2
The gin was stolen right from under the barkeep's nose. Now his life hangs by a thread – the mysterious client is clearly not someone who forgives mistakes. He’s offering one hundred and fifty doubloons to anyone who can retrieve the barrel. I have a few ideas. First step: question the sailors. Maybe one of them saw something.
#TEXT 3
This whole story truly sounds suspicious. But I think I’ve got a theory about what really happened. Time to speak with the waitress.
#TEXT 4
Under pressure, the waitress confessed that the whole scene was staged by someone named Jack Wales. Together with the captain of the 'Sea Beast', they put on quite a performance to steal the barrel. Such effort for gin! Looks like they’re not just drinkers, but true connoisseurs. The thief's house is just a few steps away – right across from the tavern.
#TEXT 5
I managed to return the barrel to the tavern keeper just in time, saving his skin from serious trouble. To be fair, he repaid me well: besides the doubloons, I was granted lifetime rights to free drinks and lodging at his tavern. As for the waitress, she wisely disappeared – the tavern keeper quickly figured out her involvement in the scheme.
#TEXT 6
The crew of the 'Sea Beast' followed their captain. Did they deserve such a fate? Who’s to say... But one thing is certain – they should’ve thought twice before challenging me.

Stolen Memory
#TEXT 1
Rumor has it that Julie d’Armagnac, the niece of the governor himself, is more sorrowful than ever in Port-au-Prince. Once radiant and cheerful, she now walks around gloomier than a storm cloud. No one knows exactly what could have changed the girl so much, but clearly something serious has happened.
#TEXT 2
Julie has found herself in a difficult position. A necklace dear to her heart has been stolen. She can’t turn to the guards—her uncle, the governor of the French part of Hispaniola, strictly forbade her from contacting the one who gave her the gift. She suspects her own servant may be the thief. I simply can’t leave her alone with this misfortune and have firmly decided to help. I suppose I should start by questioning the local merchants—the thief surely rushed to sell the jewel.
#TEXT 3
A certain Tristan Renier, captain of the 'Golden Seagull' recently purchased a necklace from a trader, which might belong to Julie. His ship is still anchored in the port. If my hunch is right, the thief might be none other than Giselle, whose name the merchant let slip by accident.
#TEXT 4
Tristan wasn’t on board. I should look for him in town.
#TEXT 5
I’ve managed to retrieve Julie’s necklace. Now it’s time to return it to its rightful owner. Or... perhaps pay a visit to the governor and tell him everything?

The necklace has been returned to its charming owner. The thief turned out to be her maid—Giselle herself. Julie is now unleashing all her cunning to punish the trickster. I wouldn’t want to be in her place.

Tales circulate through Saint Pierre of local fisherman Pierre Carno's disappearance. For two full turns of the tide, his vessel has failed to return to harbor, while his wife Lea, harrowed by dread, maintains her lonely watch at the quayside, her eyes searching the churning waters for her husband's form. Only his safe return could balm her wounded spirit. Yet the merciless sea keeps its secrets, and with each passing bell, hope wanes thinner and his chances of cheating death grow ever more slight​.
#TEXT   2
Lea divulged that her husband had set his course for Le Marin Bay, tucked along the southern shores of the island. Two full days have passed since he cast off, yet no sign of his return. The anguish etched upon this poor woman's countenance moved me to offer my aid. I shall first survey the waters of Le Marin Bay—mayhap Pierre remains at sea, delayed by circumstance. Should the waters prove empty of his presence, I must then scour the shoreline for any trace of man or vessel​.
#TEXT   3
Those beach-dwelling smugglers mistook me for one of the governor's hounds and sought to dispatch me to a watery grave. Fortune, however, turned her face from them—their own blood now stains the sand instead of mine. I must now investigate the sea cave they spoke of. Mayhap 'tis Pierre they've been keeping chained in that damp prison​.
#TEXT   4
Pierre now breathes the sweet air of freedom, and the time has come to return him to his devoted wife's embrace. Fate dealt him a cruel hand—his skiff dashed upon the reef, then once ashore, he fell into the clutches of those addled smugglers who mistook him for a governor's agent. The poor soul endured torture and starvation, pressed to reveal secrets he never possessed. One shudders to think what grim end might have awaited had Providence not guided my steps to that accursed cave when it did​.
#TEXT   5
Pierre has been safely returned to his devoted wife's tender care. He has pledged to show his gratitude once his strength returns and insists upon sharing a drink at the tavern tomorrow after the sixth bell. Yet a question still gnaws at my thoughts like a rat on ship's rope—who were those ill-fated smugglers truly awaiting on Le Marin's shores? Their talk spoke of a vessel soon to make landfall. The governor's men would surely pay handsomely for advance warning of such a ship laden with contraband. Or perhaps...​.

I have reported to the governor about the smugglers who were expecting a ship. He has promised to investigate, and I am to visit him again in three days. Should my report prove accurate, a reward may well be mine​.

Mystery of Betsy Price

In Willemstad, I heard an intriguing story – the local tavern recently acquired a waitress of extraordinary beauty, but three days ago she suddenly disappeared. The tavern keeper is worried and willing to pay whoever can find her.
#TEXT	2
The rumors aren't false; the waitress has indeed vanished. The tavern keeper is clearly concerned... whether about her disappearance or his falling profits, who knows. He's ready to pay a hundred doubloons to whoever brings her back. I've agreed to help him search. A hundred doubloons is good motivation, but what intrigues me more is Betsy herself. What kind of woman could so captivate men that they were willing to drop everything and sit for hours in the tavern just to look at her? To begin with, we should examine her house. According to the innkeeper, it's not far from the tavern, on the hill—across from the fancy house with the blue balcony.
#TEXT	3
Betsy is clearly involved in some dark affairs. The letter I found is a direct threat to her life, which means the reason for her disappearance is far more serious than simply running away. She may have managed to hide, but we can't rule out a worse outcome. I should find out who might have left this message. I'll start with the bartender – perhaps he noticed suspicious people around her.
#TEXT	4
The pendant bought from the vagabond belongs to Betsy. He found it in the flowerbed near the house with the lantern. We need to take a good look around there.
#TEXT	5
Well, what a woman this Betsy is... Or is it Miranda? No, let's stick with Betsy – no need to prod at her past. Anyway, she's been pulled from the clutches of those bastards... Time to claim the well-deserved reward.

The tavern keeper has paid me in full for returning his valuable waitress. To be honest, thoughts of Betsy still don't leave me... Perhaps I should visit her sometime.
